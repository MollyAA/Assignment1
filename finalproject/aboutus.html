        <div id="aboutustext">
        <p>The idea for Beanie Macaroons started around October 22nd 2014. When I creator and manager, Claire Kohv ,wanted to put my dream of owning a cafe into action. So, I left my old boring office job and set off! My two favorite things are coffee and macaroons, I always wanted somethng centered around it. That's where our name and our special coffee flavored macaroon comes from. After two years of planning, searching, and creating it's finally open! All the food is made from scratch giving you a top quality experience. Our smoothies are hand made, our tea and coffee is always freshly brewed and our lattes always have foam art. We here at Beanie Macron hope you stop by and check us out for yourself!</p>
        <p>
            Sincerely Manager and Founder,</p>
